Project work for DAND - OSM Data Wrangling

Project 3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
In this project, you’ll use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity,
accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the
world that you care about.
Supporting Lesson Content: Data Wrangling with MongoDB or SQL
Lesson Title Learning Outcomes
DATA EXTRACTION
FUNDAMENTALS

➔ Parse XML & HTML
➔ Scrape websites for relevant data
DATA QUALITY ➔ Understand common sources for dirty data
➔ Measure the quality of a dataset & apply a blueprint for
cleaning
➔ Properly audit validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency,
and uniformity of a dataset
WORKING WITH
MONGODB
➔ Understand how data is modeled in MongoDB
➔ Run field and projection queries
➔ Import data into MongoDB using mongoimport
➔ Utilize operators like $gt, $lt, $exists, $regex
➔ Query arrays and using $in and $all operators
➔ Change entries using $update, $set, $unset
ANALYZING DATA ➔ Identify common examples of the aggregation framework
➔ Use aggregation pipeline operators $match, $project, $unwind,
$group
SQL FOR DATA ANALYSIS ➔ Understand how data is structured in SQL
➔ Run queries to summarize data
➔ Use joins to combine information across tables
➔ Create tables and import data from csv
CASE STUDY:
OPENSTREETMAP DATA
➔ Use iterative parsing for large datafiles
